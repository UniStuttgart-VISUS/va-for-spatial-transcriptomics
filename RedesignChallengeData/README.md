# Bio+MedVis Challenge 2024 - Data
This directory contains the data that was provided for the *redesign* challenge. 
The data set was provided through [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1t6aeMDh2l067_6DEMFyovtRO5swZieBF?usp=sharing).
The large `FeatureMatrix.mtx` file of the original data set is not included since it is not used. 

## Licensing
The conditions under which this data can be used (beyond the challenge) has not been stated explicitly. 
However, the data has likely been extracted from ["10X Visium spatial RNA-seq from adult mouse brain sections paired to single-nucleus RNA-seq"](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-11114) (sample ST8059049) which is covered by the terms of [EMBL-EBI data resources](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/licencing).
