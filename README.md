This repository contains the code for the visual analytics system prototype that was proposed as a solution for the [2024 Bio+MedVis Challenge](http://biovis.net/2024/biovisChallenges_vis/).
The software is a [Bokeh server](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/server.html) application written in Python that provides a web front-end.
